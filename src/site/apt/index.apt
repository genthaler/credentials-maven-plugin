Credentials Maven Plugin

	The ability to look up credentials in a file that's only visible to the user
	running Maven is one of the great selling points of Maven. Some plugins that
	support this functionality include the {{{http://maven.apache.org/scm/maven-scm-plugin}Maven SCM Plugin}}, 
	{{{http://mojo.codehaus.org/sql-maven-plugin}SQL Maven Plugin}} and 
	{{{http://mojo.codehaus.org/dbunit-maven-plugin}DbUnit Maven Plugin}}.
	
	Unfortunately some important plugins don't yet support this functionality,
	such as the {{{http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-scm-publish-plugin}SCM Publish Maven Plugin}}.
	
	This plugin looks up credentials in ~/.m2/settings.xml, and sets them to specifiable Maven and/or Java system properties.
	
	Also provides the ability to set the username and password via system
	properties. This is to support situations where the credentials may not be
	available in all execution environments, but setting the credentials in plain text is controlled, 
	such as continuous integration servers.
	
	By way of attribution, this plugin is essentially a mashup of the 
	{{{http://mojo.codehaus.org/sql-maven-plugin}SQL Maven Plugin}} and the
	{{{http://mojo.codehaus.org/properties-maven-plugin}Properties Maven Plugin}}, 
	with some help from {{{http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/sandbox/trunk/examples/plugins/maven-security-mojo}this example}}.
