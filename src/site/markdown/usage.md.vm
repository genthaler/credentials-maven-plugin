Just a short word on encrypted credentials, it looks like if you want to encrypt some of your credentials you have to encrypt them all i.e. it&apos;s all or nothing.

For an idea of how to use this plugin, it&apos;s instructive to look at some of the [integration tests](${project.scm.url}/tree/${project.artifactId}-${project.version}/src/it).

In many cases, you want to enable the setting of system properties; it&apos;s the only way to get properties into JUnit tests (unless you don&apos;t fork) or the [Antrun Maven Plugin](maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-antrun-plugin).

If you want to override particular credentials, simply define the properties that this plugin would have defined on the command line using the -D switch. The [Credentials Maven Plugin](/) won&apos;t try to re-set these properties.

The execution of this plugin&apos;s goal can be bound to a phase of the build lifecycle, usually the validate phase.

The simplest way of configuring the ${project.artifactId} is as follows
	<project>
	  [...]
	  <build>
	    <plugins>
	      <plugin>
	        <groupId>com.github.genthaler</groupId>
	        <artifactId>credentials-maven-plugin</artifactId>
	        <version>${project.version}</version>
	        <executions>
	          <execution>
	            <id>set-all</id>
	            <goals>
	              <goal>set-all</goal>
	            </goals>
	          </execution>
	        </executions>
	      </plugin>
	      [...]
	    </plugins>
	    [...]
	  </build>
	  [...]
	</project>

Here's an example of setting specific properties.

	<project>
	  [...]
	  <build>
	    [...]
	    <plugins>
	      [...]
	      <plugin>
	        <groupId>com.github.genthaler</groupId>
	        <artifactId>credentials-maven-plugin</artifactId>
	        <version>${project.version}</version>

	        <!-- common configuration shared by all executions -->
	        <configuration>
				<useSystemProperties>true</useSystemProperties>
	          [...]
	        </configuration>
	        <executions>
	          <execution>
	            <id>set</id>
	            <phase>validate</phase>
	            <goals>
	              <goal>execute</goal>
	            </goals>
	            <!-- specific configuration for this execution -->
	            <configuration>
					<usernameProperty>username</usernameProperty>
					<passwordProperty>password</passwordProperty>
					<settingsKey>my.server</settingsKey>
		            [...]
	            </configuration>
	          </execution>
	          <execution>
	            [...]
	          </execution>
	          [...]
	        </executions>
	      </plugin>
	      [...]
	    </plugins>
	    [...]
	  </build>
	  [...]
	</project>
